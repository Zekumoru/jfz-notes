# Lesson 0 Pronunciation (Pre-lesson)

Day 29 (Book 2 Day 0) - March 25, 2024

## Introduction

Welcome to the start of the second book! Before we move on to the actual lessons, there's a little pre-lesson we must take on first.

## Lengthened Sounds

If you recall, double vowels in hiragana lengthen the sound. In katakana, the lengthening of sound is done with **ー** called **ぼう** which means _"line"_. This line is written vertically if the text is from top-to-bottom and it is called **たべぼう** which means _"vertical line"_, however if the text is horizontal then the line is called **よこぼう** which means _"horizontal line"_. Japanese people simply refer to this line as **ぼう**.

Examples

1. konpyu-ta- (computer)
2. monita- (monitor)
3. inta-netto (internet)
4. heddofo-n (headphones)
5. ki-bo-do (keyboard)
6. suma-to fo-n (smart phone)

## Long Sounds vs Short Sounds

The lengthened sound can change the meaning of **がいらいご** which means _"borrowed words"_.

Examples

1.

- kora (Japanese word for "hey!")
- ko-ra (cola)

2.

- bin (Japanese word for bottle)
- bi-n (bean)

3.

- pasu (path)
- pa-su (purse)

## Double Consonants

Just like back in hiragana, double consonants must be stressed to say the correct meaning of a word.

Examples

1.

- roku (Japanese word for the number six)
- rokku (rock music)

2.

- kata (Japanese word for model or mold)
- katta- (cutter)

3.

- haka (Japanese word for grave site)
- hakka- (hacker)

## Correctly Saying Borrowed Words

You **cannot** say the borrowed words in English accent. I mean, you can but you will be better understood if you use the Japanese pronunciation. Therefore, it is best to consider these borrowed words as Japanese words. For example, if you are looking for a hotel in Japan, make sure to say _hoteru_.

## Vocabulary

Just like in the first book, these words should be memorized but it's not an obligation to do so. As you will notice, there are now groupings of the words, they already exist in the first book but I didn't know how useful they can be before, therefore, the grouping subtitles will now be included.

## Summary

In this pre-lesson, we learned the vowel sound lengthener in katakana which is **ー** called **ぼう** meaning _"line"_ (if the line is horizontal it's called **よこぼう** and it's called **たべぼう** if it is written vertically).

We also got a refresher on double consonants and how not stressing on the second consonant or not lengthening the vowel sound can lead to an entirely different word.

And finally we learned that borrowed words are called **がいらいご** in Japanese and that we must say them in Japanese pronunciation if we want to be better understood.
