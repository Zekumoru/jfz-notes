# Pre-Lesson B

Day 2 - February 20, 2024

## Impressions

As a foreigner learning Japanese the first time, you'll most likely be forgiven if you don't do your introductions correctly. But of course, introducing yourself is one of the things you need to be good at. After all, you only get one first impression.

## Bowing

Bowing is as important to Japanese people as shaking hands is with others. When bowing, men normally have their hands near the body while women have their hands on their thighs with their fingertips overlapping or touching.

A 30-degrees bow held for about two seconds is standard when **first meeting someone**. The informal everyday bow is 15-degrees held about a second or two. Being bowed to in Japan is really common. Also, it is not necessary to bow to waiters or staffs in a store, a head nod will suffice.

## Conversation

When first meeting someone: `Hajimemashite` (Nice to meet you. / How do you do?).

Introducing your name: `____ to moushimasu` (My name is ____. / I am called ____.).

Wishing each other the best: `Yoroshiku onegai shimasu` (Best regards. / I look forward to working with you.).

> Actually, `Yoroshiku onegai shimasu` is a multi-purpose phrase therefore it has different meanings depending on the circumstances. In this case, it could also mean _"Let's be nice to each other."_.

## Asking age

Though it could be awkward to ask for someone's age in a first meeting, knowing how to ask their age or tell your age is still a plus.

| Ro-maji        | English              |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Nansai desu ka | How old are you?     |
| ____ sai desu  | I am ____ years old. |

The word `sai` literally means _"years old"_. It must always be appended after the number of your age.

There's another natural way of asking someone's age and responding to it. (Thanks to Macha for pointing this out!)

| Ro-maji         | English          | Notes                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Oikutsu desu ka | How old are you? | Or literally "How many/much are you?" |
| ____ desu       | I am ____.       |                                       |

As usual, there are _irregulars_ and versions of the number which must be used when telling your age. The chart below will show those to you. For other ages, they obey the same rules of saying the number of your age plus `sai`.

| Ro-maji   | English       | Notes                         |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| issai     | 1 year old    | never "ichi sai"              |
| yon sai   | 4 years old   | never "shi sai"               |
| nana sai  | 7 years old   | never "shichi sai"            |
| hassai    | 8 years old   | never "hachi sai"             |
| kyuu sai  | 9 years old   | never "ku sai"                |
| jussai    | 10 years old  | never "juu sai"               |
| hatachi   | 20 years old  | never "ni juu sai"            |
| hyaku sai | 100 years old | sometimes said as "hyakkusai" |

The irregulars set the pattern for all the numbers that follow. For example, to say 27 years old, it is `ni juu nana sai`. Another example is the tens like 40 or 90 years old, it is `yon jussai` and `kyuu jussai` respectively.

Notice that 20 years old is `hatachi` and that 100 years old can be `hyakkusai`.

> Why `hatachi` and not `ni juu sai`? Based on the [answers in JFZ forum](https://www.fromzero.com/ask/why-use-hatachi-instead-of-ni-juu-sai-when-saying-someone-is-20-years-old), `hatachi` is the age you become an adult in Japan therefore being 20 years old is special. There are surely must be some history behind it but you're free to dive deeper if you want, do please tell me if you did research for it. By the way, `hatachi` can only mean 20 years old and **you cannot** use it to say 21 years old, etc.

## How old do I look?

The probable response to `nansai desu ka` could be `nansai ni miemasu ka` which means _"How old do I look?"_. Do remember though that an honest answer could be brutal, so do be kind with your answer!

You can then respond to it by saying `____ sai ni miemasu` which means *"You look ____ years old"*.

## Speaking naturally

As with any language, there are _"grammatically correct"_ and _"culturally correct"_. For example, to ask someone's name, you say `(O)namae wa nan desu ka` (The 'O' can be omitted) which means _"What's your name?"_, then you respond `Watashi no namae wa ____ desu` which means *"My name is ____"* which is grammatically correct but not natural compared to `____ to moushimasu`.
