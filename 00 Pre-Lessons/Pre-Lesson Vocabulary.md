# Pre-Lesson Vocabulary

Day 3 - February 21, 2024

## Introduction

As you have seen by now, there is the **Words** section below in each pre-lessons. The words contained within that section is not mandatory to learn but starting today, along with the **Words** section, there will be the new **Vocabulary** section which **you are obliged** to learn.

If you remember back in pre-lesson A, there is this notion of _"progressive learning"_ and that's what the column you'll see below with its name is all about which is, of course, words that will eventually have kana in them when their corresponding kana is learned.

Kana is just the term to refer to both hiragana and katakana.
