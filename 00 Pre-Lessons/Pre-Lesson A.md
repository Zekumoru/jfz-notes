# Pre-Lesson A

Day 0 - February 18, 2024

## Writing Systems

There are three main writing systems in Japanese:

1. Hiragana
2. Katakana
3. Kanji

Hiragana and Kanji are used to form the Japanese words while Katakana is used for words of foreign origin.

Another writing system is called ro-maji which is the roman alphabet or what you're reading right now!

## Pronunciation

### Double vowels

In Japanese, double vowels denote the lengthening of sound.

For example, the word `mother` in Japanese is `okaasan` where you pronounce the double `aa` longer because if you don't, it might end up sounding `okasan` which is the same as saying `mister Oka`.

> `san` means `mister` or `mr.` so in this case, `okasan` or correctly spelled `oka-san`, means `Mr. Oka`.

### Double consonants

Double consonants on the other hand means to put more "stress" on the consonant, make it be heard more, otherwise it could mean an entire word again.

For example, the past tense of the verb `wait` in Japanese is `matta`, if you don't stress the middle `t`, it'll sound like `mata` which is the Japanese word for `again`.

## Words

These are the list of words in this chapter. They're not mandatory but helpful to build your vocabulary faster.

> Where are the hiragana/katakana/kanji? The JFZ's books series has this notion of _"progressive learning"_ which means it'll introduce the hiragana/katakana/kanji in the words when they are learned.
