## Counting

| Ro-maji         | number |
| --------------- | ------ |
| rei, maru, zero | 0      |
| ichi            | 1      |
| ni              | 2      |
| san             | 3      |
| shi, yon        | 4      |
| go              | 5      |
| roku            | 6      |
| shichi, nana    | 7      |
| hachi           | 8      |
| ku, kyuu        | 9      |
| juu             | 10     |

Why are some numbers have more pronunciations/versions like `0`, `4`, `7`, and `9`? Sometimes one of the version must be used instead of the others but most of the time, it's personal preference.

Cultural reasons also affect the preference of using a certain version. For example, number `4` is either `yon` or `shi` but `shi` means _death_ in Japan. Another example is the number `9` which has either `kyuu` or `ku` but `ku` also means _suffering_.

> For this reason, the numbers `4` and `9` are considered to be unlucky in Japan. For example, many apartment buildings don't use those two numbers.

### The teens

Prepend `juu` to each number to form a teen number. For example, `17` in Japanese is `juu shichi` or `juu nana`.

Teen numbers are from 11-19.

| ro-maji              | number |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| juu ichi             | 11     |
| juu ni               | 12     |
| juu san              | 13     |
| juu yon, juu shi     | 14     |
| juu go               | 15     |
| juu roku             | 16     |
| juu nana, juu shichi | 17     |
| juu hachi            | 18     |
| juu kyuu, juu ku     | 19     |

The other versions have the same reasons as stated before.

### The tens

For tens, simply prepend the single digit number to `10` or `juu` with some few exceptions which you'll see in the notes below.

| ro-maji   | number | notes              |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| juu       | 10     |                    |
| ni juu    | 20     |                    |
| san juu   | 30     |                    |
| yon juu   | 40     | never "shi juu"    |
| go juu    | 50     |                    |
| roku juu  | 60     |                    |
| nana juu  | 70     | never "shichi juu" |
| hachi juu | 80     |                    |
| kyuu juu  | 90     | never "ku juu"     |

### The hundreds

The concept is the same as the tens but with exceptions and irregulars as you'll see in the table below.

| ro-maji    | number | notes                |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| hyaku      | 100    |                      |
| ni hyaku   | 200    |                      |
| san byaku  | 300    | never "san hyaku"    |
| yon hyaku  | 400    | never "shi hyaku"    |
| go hyaku   | 500    |                      |
| roppyaku   | 600    | never "roku hyaku"   |
| nana hyaku | 700    | never "shichi hyaku" |
| happyaku   | 800    | never "hachi hyaku"  |
| kyuu hyaku | 900    | never "ku kyaku"     |

### The thousands

The concept is the same as the tens and hundreds but with exceptions and irregulars as you'll see in the table below.

| ro-maji    | number | notes              |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| sen, issen | 1000   |                    |
| ni sen     | 2000   |                    |
| san zen    | 3000   | never "san sen"    |
| yon sen    | 4000   |                    |
| go sen     | 5000   |                    |
| roku sen   | 6000   |                    |
| nana sen   | 7000   | never "shichi sen" |
| hassen     | 8000   | never "hachi sen"  |
| kyuu sen   | 9000   | never "ku sen"     |

### Formulating numbers

Now that we've learned how to pronounce digits, tens, hundreds, and thousands, how do we form a number with the mix of those? **Just string/join/concatenate them!**.

#### Examples

| numbers | ro-maji                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| 746     | nana hyaku yon juu roku       |
| 8413    | hassen yon hyaku juu san      |
| 217     | ni hyaku juu nana             |
| 3857    | sanzen happyaku go juu shichi |
| 5392    | go sen san byaku kyuu juu ni  |

> Pay attention to `400` which is `yon hyaku` and **not** `yoppyaku`!
