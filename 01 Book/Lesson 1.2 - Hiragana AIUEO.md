## Some history

**Hiragana** was created by a Buddhist monk around 774-853 AD and at that time hiragana was primarily used by women because it was believed that women were not allowed to learn the intricacy of Kanji.

**Katakana** was created using portions of Kanji while the more rounded hiragana was created by simplifying kanji.

**Kanji** has over 10K characters and in 1981, the Japanese Ministry of Education announced 1945 commonly used kanji called the **Joyou Kanji**. By the 6th grade, students already know half of it. Since then, the Joyou Kanji has been expanded.

## Writing Basics

### What is a stroke?

A stroke begins when the pen comes in contact with the paper and ends when it leaves from the paper.

### Why are brushed used to write?

Brushed are used to write Japanese because it bests represent how the characters should be written.

### Types of strokes

There are 3 types of strokes:

1. **`Tome`** (means "stop"): stop at the end of a stroke.
2. **`Hane`** (means "jump" or "bounce fade"): end the stroke with a slight flick.
3. **`Harai`** (means "sweep" or "fade out"): end the stroke by gradually diminishing the line to a point.

## Writing Styles

There are two types of writing styles: **Left-to-right** and **top-to-bottom**.

Prior to World War 2, Japanese publications were written with the top-to-bottom style. Now, in modern Japan, both styles are used and acceptable therefore it's up to one's preference which one to use.
