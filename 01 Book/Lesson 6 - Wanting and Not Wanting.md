## 5 | Culture Clip カルチャークリップ

You might see **くn** or **chan** after someone's first or last name. They are both used to show affection, however, _chan_ is mostly used after girls' names and _くn_ after boys' names.

That being said, _chan_ when referring to children can be both used to both sex. Also, you might also see a higher-up in a company append _くn_ to their female staff members.

_Chan_ and _くn_ should **never be used** when addressing people above you in social status. Therefore, if you ever hear someone addressing another person with _くn_ or _chan_ then that means that person is equal or higher in status than the person they're addressing to.

## 6 | Grammar ぶんぽう

### 6.1 | Making adjectives negative

Previously we learned to make nouns negative using jaない. To make い-adjectives negative, we **drop the い then replace it with くない**.

Examples

1.

- あたraしい -> new
- あたraし**くない** -> **not** new

2.

- さmuい -> cold
- さmu**くない** -> **not** cold

3.

- あつい -> hot
- あつ**くない** -> **not** hot

4.

- furuい -> old
- furu**くない** -> **not** old

### 6.2 | Negative color adjectives

Same principle applies to the adjective versions of the colors.

Examples

1.

- あかい -> red
- あか**くない** -> **not** red

2.

- chaいroい -> brown
- chaいro**くない** -> **not** brown

### 6.3 | Wanting and not wanting

_"Want"_ in Japanese is **hoしい**. Like with すき and きraい, we also use **が** to mark the thing we want or don't want.

Examples

1. _"あたraしいterebi**が**hoしいです。"_ -> _"I want a new television."_
2. _"つmeたいのmimoの**が**hoしいです。"_ -> _"I want a cold drink."_

To say you don't want something, drop the い and replace with くない just like how we make adjectives negative.

Examples

1. _"Furuいくrumaがhoしくないです。"_ -> _"I don't want an old car."_
2. _"ぬruいmiずがhoしくないです。"_ -> _"I don't want warm water."_

> Don't forget that the negative version of きraい is きraいjaない and **NOT** きraくない!

### 6.4 | A tip regarding の

If you remember previously, we learned that の shows possessions (e.g. waたしのくruma) and makes a noun into an adjective (e.g. にhonごのhon).

Look at this sentence: _"**Waたしのとmoだちのあきこさん**waにjuごさいです。"_ (_"**My friend Akiko** is 25 years old."_) It looks daunting but just remember that the key function of の is to make the noun or word after it into a modifier (の-adjective) therefore _"Waたしのとmoだちの"_ is just modifying _"あきこさん"_.

### 6.5 | Numbers and money

To say 100 dollars or 100 yen, just add _doru_ or _えn_ after the number. The の particle is not required.

Examples

1. 100 yen -> Hyaくえn
2. 1000 dollars -> せn doru

### 6.6 | Counting above 10,000

In Japan, there's a unit after _せn_ (thousand) which is _man_ (ten thousand). To say 10K, you **NEVER** say _juうせn_! There does **NOT** exist anything above _せn_ after the 9 meaning the maximum for _せn_ is _kyuうせn_.

Examples

1. 10K -> いちman
2. 20K -> にman
3. 30K -> さnman
4. 40K -> yonman (never しman)
5. 50K -> ごman
6. 60K -> roくｍan
7. 70K -> ななman (never しちman)
8. 80K -> haちman
9. 90K -> kyuうman (never くman)

Oh and a nice excerpt from the book: _"For English speakers the MAN unit is a new concept. This is hard to get used to at first, but imagine how Japanese people feel about LOSING a counter and using 1000 in English. ☺"_

Also, now you can count up to **99,999,999**! Which is of course... Breaths in... **kyuう せn kyuう hyaく kyuう juう kyuう man kyuう せn kyuう hyaく kyuう juう kyuう**.

## 7 | Summary ようやく

That was definitely a lot to take in especially with the introduction of _man_ to say 10 thousand. But anyways...

In this lesson, we learned a new phrase to say we're fine or _"No thanks."_ which is **"けっこうです。"**

Afterward, we got a glimpse to another culture clip about _くn_ and _chan_ which is appended to someone's first name or last name to show affection. And learned it's only used with people we have the same status or lower and **never** higher.

We also learned to make い-adjectives negative with **くない**. Then we learned how to say if we want or don't want something with **hoしい** and **hoしくない** respectively.

Finally, we got introduced to a new number unit called _man_ to say 10 thousand which is definitely new for us and something to get used to in the future!

> Don't forget in the new words section, there's, let's say, another _"phrase"_ we learned which is **moちron** to say _"of course"_!
