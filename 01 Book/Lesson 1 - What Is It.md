# Lesson 1 - What Is It?

Day 4 - February 22, 2024

## Introduction

Finally! We're starting the first lesson! Be sure to review the mandatory words from **Pre-Lesson Vocabularies**. This lesson will teach about asking and answering simple questions therefore also the `ka` particle.

Also, as promised, I won't be using tables anymore since they're really wonky when pasting on Discord. Needless to say, the new format might be updated in the future.

> What? Those are tables! Well, yeah but for each word and if I need write a note for a specific word, I can put it below than in the table itself.

## Phrases

1. `Wakarimasu ka`: _Do you understand?_
2. `Hai, wakarimasu`: _Yes, I understand._
3. `Iie, wakarimasen`: _No, I don't understand._
4. `Wakarimasen`: _I don't understand. / I don't know._ (Usually means _"I don't know."_)
5. `Mou ichido itte kudasai`: _Please say it once again._
6. `Motto yukkuri itte kudasai`: _Please speak more slowly._

## Grammar

### Plurals

The Japanese language _does not_ have plurals therefore a word like `mimi` can either mean `ear` or `ears` depending on the context. However, there exists plural forms but not a concern for now.

### Desu

Pronounced _"des"_ and it means _"to be"_.

Examples:

1. `Makura desu`: _**It is** a pillow_.
2. `Tanaka desu`: _**I am** Tanaka_.
3. `Kobayashi-san desu`: _**She is** Ms. Kobayashi_.
4. `Sekken desu`: _**It's** soap_.

### Ka

`Ka` is the equivalent of a question mark in English. Appending it to a sentence makes the statement a question.

Examples:

1. `Makura desu ka`: _**Is it** a pillow?_
2. `Tanaka-san desu ka`: _**Are you** Tanaka?_
3. `Kobayashi-san desu ka`: _**Is she** Ms. Kobayashi?_
4. `Sekken desu ka`: _**Is it** soap_?

### Nani / Nan

It means _"what"_. `Nani` can be used alone while `nan` needs to be paired with a word.

Examples:

1. `Nan desu ka`: _What is it?_
2. `Nansai desu ka`: _How old are you?_
3. `Nani iro desu ka`: _What color is it?_
4. `Nani ga suki desu ka`: _What do you like?_

## Culture Clip: San

`san` is appended to a person's first or last name and it is used when you don't know the person or the person in question is older or above you in status.

`san` is **never** used to refer to oneself or to family members.

## Words

1. `wakaru`: _to understand_ (from conjugated `wakarimasu` and `wakarimasen`)
2. `ka`: _?_ (a question particle)
3. `mou`: _again_
4. `ichido`: _once again_ / _one more time_
5. `kudasai`: _please_
6. `motto`: _more_
7. `yukkuri`: _slowly_ (adverb)
8. `iro`: _color_
9. `suki`: _like_ (or _"to like"_, however, this is an adjective, not a verb.)
