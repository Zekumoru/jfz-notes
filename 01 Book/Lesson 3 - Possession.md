## 3 | New Phrases

1. **soうdesu**

- English: _**That's right**_

This phrase is used when something said is true or correct. It's not limited to meaning _"That's right"_, it could also mean _"It is"_, _"You're right"_, or simply just _"Yes"_.

2. **chiがいmasu**

- English: _**That's wrong**_

This phrase is used when something said is false or incorrect. It can also have different meanings such as _"It's different."_, _"It ins't."_, or just _"No"_.

## 4 | Culture Clip: boく

**Boく** means _"I"_ or _"me"_ and only males normally use it. It should only be used in a casual conversation. It can also be used to sound cute or sound masculine depending on usage.

Also, boく can also refer to little boys, for example _"Boく wa nansaい desu か"_ means _"How old are you (little boy)?"_ and **not** _"How old am I?"_.

You'd normally won't hear girls using the word boく perhaps exception being they're trying to sound boyish or singing a song in a male's perspective. Young girls often say **あtashi** as an informal and cute of saying watashi.

## 5 | Grammar ぶんぽう

### 5.1 | _dare_

**dare** is a question word that means _"who"_. Its usage is similar to _nan_, _dore_, and _docchi_.

Example

1. _"**Dare** desu か"_ -> _"**Who** is it?"_

### 5.2 | Using _wa_ with _dare_

You can specify the topic with the topic marker _wa_ just like how we used it in the previous lessons.

Examples

1. _"あnata wa dare **desu** か。"_ -> _"**Who** are you?"_
2. _"Watashi wa こbayashi desu."_ -> _"I am Kobayashi."_
3. _"Senseい wa **dare** desu か。"_ -> _"**Who** is the teacher?"_
4. _"Yamada san desu."_ -> _"It's Mr./Mrs. Yamada."_
5. _"Tanaか san wa **dare** desu か。"_ -> _"*Who** is Mr./Mrs. Tanaka?"_
6. _"Nihonご no senseい desu."_ -> _"(She's / He's) a Japanese teacher."_

### 5.3 | Assume the topic based on context

As stated in the previous lesson, it is normal in Japanese to drop the topic therefore the question _"Dare desu か"_ can mean anyone assuming you don't know the context.

Examples

1. **Context:** Looking at an unknown person in a photograph.

- A: Dare desu か。(Who is this person?)
- B: Tanaか san desu. (It's Mr./Mrs. Tanaka.)

2. **Context:** Someone calls you on the phone not knowing who they are.

- A: Dare desu か。(Who is this?)
- B: Tanaか desu. (It's Tanaka.)

3. **Context:** Looking at a girl in the hallway.

- A: Dare desu か。(Who is she?)
- B: Mayumi desu. (She's Mayumi.)

### 5.4 | Where the question words are placed

It's common in English to put the question word first when formulating a question. In Japanese however, you will notice that it usually doesn't start with a question word when formulating a question sentence.

Examples

1. _"こre wa **nan** desu か。"_ -> _"**What** is this?"_
2. _"くruma wa dore desu か。”_ -> _"**Which one** is the car?"_
3. _"Tanaか san wa dare desu か。"_ -> _"**Who** is Mr./Mrs. Tanaka?"_

Notice how in English question words are at the beginning while in Japanese they're in the middle of the sentence.

### 5.5 | Start a sentence with a question word with が

Even though Japanese doesn't generally start with a question word, there are times when this is acceptable or necessary. And this can be done using the subject marker が. If you're planning on using the question word first in a sentence, note that you must use が after the question word.

> I hope it can be clarified in the future what's the difference between _wa_ and _が_ since right now, I tried looking for their differences but there's a bit of debate I'd say. It seems before we can completely understand their differences, we need to know the other particles.

Examples

1. _"**Dore** が くruma desu か。"_ -> _"**Which one** is a car?"_
2. _"**Dare** が Tanaか san desu か。"_ -> _"**Who** is Tanaka?"_

When answering to a question which started with a question word, remember to respond in the same pattern, in other words, use が.

Examples

1. _"**Docchi** が くruma desu か。"_ -> _"**Which one** (of these two) is a car?"_
2. _"**Socchi** が くruma desu."_ -> _"That's a car."_
3. _"**Dare** が Tanaか san desu か。"_ -> _"**Who/Which** is Tanaka?"_

> Fascinatingly, you can use **dare** to mean _which_. To understand this, imagine you're looking at a photo with a friend and you want to ask which of the people in the group is Tanaか then you can use _dare_ like the question above.

4. _"Tanaか san が tomodachi desu."_ -> _"Tanaka is a friend."_

> It seems the book really loves the surname Tanaか.

### 5.6 | The possessive particle _no_

To convert pronouns into possessive, simply add _no_ to it.

Examples

- mine -> watashi **no**
- mine -> boく **no**
- yours -> あnata **no**
- hers -> かnojo **no**
- his -> かre **no**
- whose -> dare **no**

_No_ also acts the possessive _'s_ when it follows a person's name or other words.

Examples

- Akiko's -> あきこ **no**
- Jeff's -> Jeffu **no**
- Mother's -> おかあsan **no**

To ask a question whose an item is, you say _dare no desu か_.

Examples

1. _"こre wa **dare no** desu か。"_ -> _"**Whose** is this?"_
2. _"あnata no desu."_ -> _"It's yours."_

### 5.7 | More on _no_

You also use _no_ to show possession of an object. Think of _no_ as a glue which holds nouns together.

Examples

1. _"かre **no** いnu"_ -> _"his dog"_
2. _"あnata **no** おかあsan"_ -> _"Your mother"_

_No_ is not limited to two items. It can further clarify the object or item being discussed.

Examples

1. _"あnata **no** かnojo **no** namaえ wa nan desu か。"_ -> _"What's your girlfriend's name?"_
2. _"Dare が こbayashi san no おtoうsan desu か。"_　-> _"Who is Mr./Mrs. Kobayashi's father?"_

## 6 | Summary

This is not part of the book but I want to summarize what you learned here since that was a lot of information.

Basically, you learned about the two new phrases **soうdesu** and **chiがいmasu** to say _"That's right"_ and _"That's wrong"_ respectively. You also learned that **boく** is mostly used by male and it can also be used to refer to young boys. Also that **あtashi** is used by young girls to cutely say watashi.

In the grammar section, you learned a new question word **dare** to ask _who_ and the a new subject marker **が**. Usage on _dare_ with the _wa_ and _が_ particles. If が is used then it must be placed after the question word whereas with _wa_ it is placed after the topic and before the question word.

You also learned a new particle **no** to indicate possession. In particular using it to form possessive pronouns like **watashi no** _(mine)_, **あnata no** _(yours)_, etc. And that it can glue sentences together to provide more clarity on the topic/subject/object being discussed.
