> You might be wondering why `o` is not `お` and that's because it's `を` (`wo`) and that hiragana when used as a particle is read as `o`. You'll learn more about this later.

## 4 | Culture Clip: Sushi and Sashimi

**Sushi** is raw or cooked fish, eggs, or vegetables on rice while **sashimi** is just sliced raw fish. Normally there's some **wasabi**, a horseradish which is very pungent, between the fish and rice in a sushi.

## 5 | Ko, So, あ, Do Patterns

`ko`, `so`, `あ`, and `do` are patterns that come up often.

- `ko`: means it's close enough to touch.
- `so`: kinda close but not enough to touch.
- `あ`: far away, definitely not close.
- `do`: question word.

It's better to memorize now what each words mean since they'll be coming up later.

## 6 | Grammar ぶんぽう

### 6.1 | The topic marker `wa`

`wa` is used to mark the topic of the sentence and it does not have any meaning in English. It can be thought of _"Speaking of **(the)**"_ or _"As for **(the)**"_. Generally, everything before `wa` is the topic or part of the topic then everything after it describes the topic or asks a question about the topic.

Examples:

1. _"あshita **wa** getsuyoうbi desu."_ which means _"Tomorrow is Monday."_
2. _"Yukari-san **wa** nihonjin desu."_ which means _"Yukari is Japanese"_
3. _"Banana **wa** kiいro desu."_ which means _"Bananas are yellow."_

### 6.2 | Asking questions with `wa`

As stated previously, anything after `wa` can be used to pose a question.

Examples:

1. _"Kore **wa** nan desu ka."_ -> _"What is this?"_
2. _"Sore **wa** kagami desu."_ -> _"That's a mirror."_
3. _"Sore **wa** nan desu ka."_ -> _"What is that?"_
4. _"Sore **wa** pen desu."_ -> _"That's a pen."_
5. _"あre **wa** banana desu."_ -> _"That over there is a banana."_
6. _"Banana **wa** nan desu ka."_ -> _"What's a banana?"_
7. _"Banana **wa** furu-tsu desu."_ -> _"A banana is a fruit."_
8. _"Retasu **wa** furu-tsu desu ka."_ -> _"Is lettuce a fruit?"_
9. _"いいえ、retasu **wa** yasaい desu."_ -> _"No, lettuce is a vegetable."_

### 6.3 | Question words `dore` and `docchi`

`Dore` and `docchi` both means _"which one?"_, however, `dore` is used when there is one or three and more items while `docchi` is used when referring to **two** items.

Examples

1. _"Kuruma wa dore desu ka."_ -> _"Which one is the car?"_
2. _"Kuruma wa docchi desu ka."_ -> _"Which one is the car?"_ (However you are asking this question with two cars in front of you.)
3. _"Yasaい wa docchi desu ka."_ -> _"Which one (between this two items) is a vegetable?"_ (The parenthesis isn't part of the Japanese sentence, it just there to show you that we are referring to two items with `docchi`)

### 6.4 | Same pattern when answering

If you are asked with a `dore` which it ends with `~re` then answer with `~re` like `kore`, `sore`, or `あre`. If the question is raised with `docchi` then answer with `~cchi` like `kocchi`, `socchi`, or `あcchi`.

Examples

1. _"Mado wa docchi desu ka."_ -> _"Which one is a window?"_
2. _"Mado wa あcchi desu."_ -> _"That one over there is a window."_
3. _"Sushi wa dore desu ka."_ -> _"Which one is a sushi?"_
4. _"Sushi wa kore desu."_ -> _"This one is a sushi."_

> You've probably noticed that there's a pattern in the sentences as well. Both the question and the answer are the same except the question ends with `ka`. In fact, the book said that _90%_ of the time, the answer is in the question.

### 6.5 | Tip when you don't know something

If you don't know something, you can ask by using `nan desu ka`.

Examples

1. _"えnpitsu wa **nan desu ka**."_ -> _"What is 'えnpitsu'?"_
2. _"えnpitsu wa pencil desu."_ -> _"えnpitsu is a pencil."_

> Suppose you don't know what a "pencil" is of course!

## 7 | Speaking Naturally しぜんにはなすこと

In English, we substitute the topic with **personal pronouns** like _I_, _you_, _he_, _they_, etc. However in Japanese, it's very common to drop the topic once it has been introduced in a conversation. Normally the topic is not mentioned again until a new topic has been introduced.

Examples

1. _"**My friend** is Michiko."_
2. _"**She** lives in Japan."_
3. _"**She** is 18 years old."_
4. _"**She** is a college student."_

Notice that the topic in English is always mentioned with the help of personal pronouns. In Japanese, it's more natural to drop it after it has been introduced.

Examples

1. _"**Watashi no tomodachi** wa Michiko san desu."_ (English: _"**My friend** is Michiko."_)
2. _"Nihon ni sundeいmasu"_ (English: _"Lives in Japan."_)
3. _"Juう hassaい desu."_ (English: _"Is 18 years old."_)
4. _"Daいgakuseい desu."_ (English: _"Is a college student."_)

See? The _"she"_ from earlier is now gone, ceased to exist.
