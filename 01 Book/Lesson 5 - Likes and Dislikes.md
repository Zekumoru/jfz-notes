## 4 | Grammar ぶんぽう

### 4.1 | が particle with すき and きraい

The が subject particle is used after the thing you like or dislike.

Examples

1. _"Waたし wa いちご**が**すきです。"_ -> _"I like strawberries."_
2. _"Waたし wa いnu **が**きraいです。"_ -> _"I dislike dogs."_
3. _"Waたし wa さかna **が**だいすきです。"_ -> _"I really like fish."_
4. _"Waたし wa retasu **が**だいきraいです。"_ -> _"I hate lettuce."_

Interestingly and I don't know why the book didn't mention it but だいすき can also mean that you _love_ something/someone. However, grammatically it's _"really like"_ and there's a word for _"love"_ (which is あい) but still, だいすき can also mean to love something/someone.

### 4.2 | Make things negative with _janaい_

**Janaい** means _"not"_ or _"don't"_ depending on the context. Janaい is most commonly used in daily conversation even though it's the informal version of _jaあrimaせｎ_, _でwa あrimaせn_, or _でwa naい_. However, adding です makes it polite. Janaい must always follow the word it is modifying.

Examples

1. _"あか**janaい**です。"_ -> _"It's **not** red."_
2. _"Waたし**janaい**です。"_ -> _"It's **not** me."_
3. _"そre **janaい**です。"_ -> _"It's **not** that one."_
4. _"きraい**janaい**です。"_ -> _"I **don't** dislike it."_

### 4.3 | The _"one"_ pronoun

Adding a _no_ after the noun version of a color or after an adjective transforms that word into a _"one"_ pronoun.

Examples

1. _"あかno"_ -> _"(A / The) red one."_
2. _"おいしいno"_ -> _"(A / The) good tasting one."_
3. _"nihon no"_ -> _"(A / The) Japanese one."_
4. Q&A

- A: _"どre がすきですか。"_ -> _"Which one do you like?"_
- B: _"**おいしいno** がすきです。"_ -> _"I like the **delicious one**."_

### 4.4 | _Jaあ_ to say _"Well then..."_

Jaあ is a common word in Japanese and it's said at the beginning of a sentence normally to follow up with a question.

Example Conversion

1. Asking if they like cats or dogs

- A: _"Neこがすきですか。"_ -> _"Do you like cats?"_
- B: _"いいえ、だいきraいです。"_ -> _"No, I hate them!"_
- A: _"**Jaあ**、いnuがすきですか。"_ -> _"**Well then**, do you like dogs?"_
- B: _"はい、だいすきです。"_ -> _"Yes, I love (like a lot) them!"_

2. Asking if it is someone's car

- A: _"あreがあnaたnoくrumaですか。"_ -> _"Is that your car?"_

> Notice that in the book they used が instead of _wa_ after _"あre"_. They didn't explain why but based on what I researched online: _が_ puts emphasis on the _"あre"_ part like _"Is **that** your car?"_ whereas if we used _wa_ then it's _"Is that **your car**?"_ Or as we learned previously, perhaps in the conversation, they were already talking about the car and it's not a new information therefore が is used since we know that _wa_ establishes a new topic.

- B: _"いいえ、ちがいmaす。"_ -> _"No, it's not."_
- A: _"**Jaあ**、どreですか。"_ -> _"**Well then**, which one is it?"_
- B: _"あreです。"_ -> _"It's that one over there."_

## 5 | Speaking Naturally しぜんにはなすこと

### 5.1 | _きraい_ vs _すきjanaい_

Using きraい or だいきraい when you don't like something is a bit harsh in Japanese so do be careful and use すきjanaい instead in everyday conversations.

## 6 | Summary ようやく

In this lesson, we learned two new adjectives to say if something is delicious or not (**おいしい** and **おいしくない** respectively).

Grammar-wise, we learned how to say if we _like_ (**すき**) or _dislike_ (**きraい**) or even _really like / love_ (**だいすき**) or _really dislike / hate_ (**だいきraい**) something (or even someone!). We also learned how to turn adjectives into negative with **janaい**, turn a noun color or an adjective into a _"one"_ pronoun using the _no_ particle, and to use **jaあ** to make a follow-up question.

Finally, a little tip not to be harsh when saying you hate something with **すきjanaい** in everyday conversations.

1. **いちご**

- English: _**strawberries**_
